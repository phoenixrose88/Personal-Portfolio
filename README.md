# Personal Portfolio

## What we did

My personal portfolio, features advanced CSS and HTML techniques.

- We were tasked with creating a portfolio from scratch to showcase our skills and talents to employers.

- When loading my webpage portfolio, one can see subheadings such as 'About Me', 'Skills and education', 'Projects' and 'Contact Me' in the Navigation Menu.

- When clicked, the links in the navigation correspond to the relevant sections on webpage.

- When presented with first application in 'Projects', the applications image is larger in size than the others and when clicked on, take the user to that webpage.

- You will also find that one is presented with a responsive layout that adapts to your viewport when resizing the page or viewing the site on various screens and devices.

- The website also allows the mouse to hover over applications notifying the user that is able to be clicked on and thus the user is directed to that application in a new tab. This applies to all clickable links in the navigation bar, 'project' images and 'contact me' sections.

## Installation

- Clone the Github project on to your local machine (C-drive)
- Navigate into the project and open project in VS code
- Right click on file to open the 'index.html' file in your default browser

To clone the project type the following as separate commands in your terminal:

- `git clone` git@github.com:phoenixrose88/Personal-Portfolio.git
- `cd homeworks`
- `cd Personal-Portfolio`
- `code .`

This should open the cloned project in VS code where one can examine the HTML and CSS and see the webpage live.
